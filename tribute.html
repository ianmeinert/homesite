                            <p>Ian first enlisted in the Marine Corps in March 1998 and later transferred to the reserves. His duty has taken him to Virgina, Ohio, Hawaii, Japan, Thailand, Okinawa, Iraq, Colorado, and Afghanistan. While deployed to Afghanistan, Ian was responsible for Information Systems and logistics, which later allowed him to relocate the Command Post to another region and to also establish the first and only secure communication path between two geographically separated compounds. This would later contribute to uncovering corruption and criminality in the region.</p>

                            <p>James served during Vietnam. In the last month before Jim was to rotate home, he was scheduled to fly as a Weapons Systems Officer in an escort mission for an AC-130 Gunship over a particularly dangerous area. To protect the Gunship, he attacked areas of heavy ground fire; unfortunately, his F4D sustained serious damage and crashed. Other aircrews described it as "a big ball of fire" on impact, so there was little chance for a crew to survive. He gave his all to protect a number of crew members on the AC-130 gunship, allowing them to complete their mission and survive. Just weeks before his fateful mission, James had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravery during earlier missions. In the absence of proof of death he was classed as missing in action; later being repatrioted in January 2011.</p>
